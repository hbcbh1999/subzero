This folder contains the code to build and expose a C shared library that exposes the low level subZero functionality.

The shared library is used by the [Java bindings](../java-bindings) to provide a high level API.

Some documentation on how to use the shared library can be found [here](https://docs.subzero.cloud/c_lib_docs/index.html)
